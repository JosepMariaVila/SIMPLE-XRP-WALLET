A simple javascript XRP wallet to check the balance and send XRP.

Download both files in a folder: xrpwallet.js xrpwallet.html

To install the required library: npm install xrpl

Open the HTML file in your browser.

Select the network. It works for Mainnet, Testnet and Devnet.

It allows to create a Mainnet account (which has to be activated later with XRP). Do it offline, it's purely mathematical.

It allows to create a Testnet or Devent account and funds it with 100 XRP. Do it online as it's not real XRP for test nets.

It allows to send XRP.
